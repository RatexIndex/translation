A simple standard for digital assets (ie. Non-Fungible Tokens)
for EOSIO blockchains by <a href="https://cryptolions.io/home">CryptoLions</a>.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Our Philosophy</h3>
Simple Assets started with the idea that a digital asset is a promise from the asset creator to the entire community of possible owners. What is the promise? It has four parts:
<p style="text-align: left;">1. that a chunk of the asset’s data will never change — <code>idata</code> .</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. that the asset author reserves the right to modify another chunk of the asset’s data — <code>mdata</code> — or to transfer this privilege to another party.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">3. that ownership functions (transferring, offering, lending, burning) are expressed entirely outside the control of the author.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. that the code controlling assets is transparent and overseen by reputable parties.</p>
